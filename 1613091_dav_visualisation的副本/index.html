          <p>There were 72.42 million UK residents visiting abroad in 2017, an increase of 3% compared with 2016. This is a new record figure, it has surpassed the 2016 figure of 70.62 million. In general, visit numbers have increased over time, from 41.88 million in 1996, although the number of visits fell sharply in 2009 in the wake of the economic downturn. Numbers have increased every year since 2012. There were 39.03 million overseas residents visits to the UK in 2017, 4% more than in 2016. This was the seventh successive increase and the highest figure recorded. Numbers of visits to the UK have increased over the years: there were 25.2 million visits 20 years ago.</p>
          <p>UK residents spent £44.7 billion on visits abroad in 2017, which was 2.3% more than in 2016. Overseas residents spent £24.32 billion on visits to the UK in 2017, an increase of 8% from 2016. Over the longer-term, the amounts spent on visits have increased broadly in line with the increases in the numbers of visits both for visits to the UK and visits overseas by UK residents.(The spending is recorded at current prices and not adjusted for inflation.)</p>
